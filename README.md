# React Wrappy Text
Unwrapping text component for React.

Ported my old [eDriven.Gui](https://github.com/dkozar/edriven-gui/blob/master/eDriven.Playground/Unity/Assets/eDriven/Demo/_shared/Code/Components/TitleLabel.cs) component, written in C# (for Unity3d game engine).

Just as a proof of concept, and because I like the effect.

## Demo
